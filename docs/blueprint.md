## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Light Grey (#F5F5F5), a desaturated variant of the primary color for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Amber (#FFC107), for highlighting key actions and interactive elements; adds energy.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern and neutral look; good for both headlines and body.
- Use a set of clean and modern icons from a library like Material Design Icons. Icons should be used to enhance usability.
- Emphasize a clean, grid-based layout for presenting information clearly. Prioritize key information above the fold. The header should be prominent and persistent. Navigation elements should be intuitive.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback. For example, button hovers and loading indicators should have transitions to create an enjoyable user experience.
